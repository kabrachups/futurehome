Some thoughts about UX (I understand it is not a real project, but anyway :) )
1. Itâ€™s better to split an account card and a devices list into separate screens. Our user should see just one dose of information: either account info, or the devices list. But not both at the same time: it's hard to understand information.
2. The better choice is material list style, not table-like style. The user's gaze must move vertically, and not on Z-trajectory. 
3. The buttons should have different emphasizes (now every button is primary (even Notes button) 

Note: one more device is added to show scrolling.
